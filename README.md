# EmberConf Chat

This is a demonstration application to accompany my talk entitled "Building Real-time Applications in Ember", which I will be giving on March 4, 2015 at [EmberConf][] in Portland, Oregon.

We'll be working with two branches:

* [websocket-controller](https://github.com/stevekinney/emberconf-chat/tree/websocket-controller)
* [websocket-server](https://github.com/stevekinney/emberconf-chat/tree/websocket-service)

[EmberConf]: http://emberconf.com/ "EmberConf 2015"

This project relies on [stevekinney/socketry-server][server] and is loosely based on [stevekinney/socketry-client][client], which I used in an earlier version of this talk given at Denver Ember.js in November of 2014.
